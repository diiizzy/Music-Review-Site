## Background

What We Have came out an interesting time in my music journey and a transitionary period for many in the world with COVID seemingly coming to halt as the entire world started to reopen. It was around this time that I started to delve into the new wave of underground rap artists that seemed to be separating themselves from the big soundcloud artists of the 2016-2017 era. 

Summrs career was beginning to gain traction, with many members of the, now defunct, rap group Slayworld such as Autumn, Yeat, and KanKan also starting to see a significant rise in listeners. At this time Summrs still had a lot to prove even though he was already seen as a pioneer of a new sound in the underground rap scene. This sound was called PluggnB. While other artists contributed to the creation and proliferation of PluggnB, for many Summrs comes to mind as one of the main contributors. Other names include Corey Lingo, Lil Shine, producer XanGang, and producer Goyxrd who produced many of Summrs songs in this era and on this EP.

With lots to prove, Summrs puts on a beautifully consistent six track performance on what remains one of my favorite rap EPs to this day and a **_must listen for PluggnB lovers_**. Unlike some of his later albums and tracks, each track has a distinct sound coupled with Summrs droney yet melodic vocals. At times the lyrical content can seem like the typical surface level subject matter that is common in rap today, however, after repeated listens I realized that these are some of his most authentic, heart-felt lyrics to date that reflect his emotions on a daily basis. It becomes clear that we are getting a window into Summrs true feelings and it is reflected by the determinism and true emotion that he puts into his verses throughout the EP.

### What We Have

It is in the first and title track **What we Have** that we begin to see what will shape the PluggnB sound for years to come that so many will try to replicate in the future. Additionally, Summrs is instantly upfront about many of the struggles and themes that we will see throughout the EP. Like many of the tracks he has written, Summrs talks about his ongoing drug addiction and how it effects his relationships, specifically with his significant others. It becomes evident that Summrs relationship with sipping lean is tied to events in his life that have negatively effected his mental health. When the chorus first hits it feels like a plea to the listener and his lover as he sings "_You taking my soul and I know you feel like this won't last, I'm on my last line, I feel like I'm sippin' it too fast_"
